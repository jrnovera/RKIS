        Who We Are
        We're a dedicated team of students, cultural researchers, and developers committed to preserving the heritage and advancing the rights of the indigenous communities in Catanauan, Quezon. This platform was created as part of an academic thesis project, designed specifically as an internal tool for administrators to digitally document and manage the rich cultural identity, history, and current realities of the Katutubo.
