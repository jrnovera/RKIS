        Our mission is to build a centralized, web-based information system that authentically represents the lives, history, and rights of the indigenous communities in Catanauan, Quezon. This system will serve as an internal administrative tool for documenting and managing their stories, empowering data-driven initiatives and fostering recognition for their benefit.
