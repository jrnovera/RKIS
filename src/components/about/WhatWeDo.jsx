        Our primary goals for this internal digital platform are to securely preserve, record, document, and manage comprehensive data on the growing indigenous communities in Catanauan, Quezon Province. This vital information includes details on their population, locations, demographics, personal information, origins, residences, occupations, educational attainment, and lineage.
